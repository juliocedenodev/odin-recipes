            This succulent piece of meat is a holiday staple in Venezuela. 
            It's a leg of pork marinated in a mixture of herbs and seasonings that is then placed in the oven until it is perfectly cooked and has a provocative golden hue.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the pork and pat the meat dry with a paper towel. Then, use the knife to poke 1-inch deep holes into the meat on all sides. Rub salt and pepper generously all over the pork, working it into the punctures. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine oil, orange juice, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and onion in a blender and blend until finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Place pork in a large ziplock bag. Add marinade, oregano, rosemary, and bay leaf. Place in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove the pork from the refrigerator 1 hour before you start cooking.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350º F (arrange racks in the middle). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil for easier cleanup.</li>
            <li>If using the oven bag: Shake 1 tablespoon of flour inside the Reynolds® Oven Bag and place it in the roasting pan. Carefully place the pork and the marinade into a Reynolds® Oven Bag, making sure the bag's opening faces the end of the roasting pan, and not facing up. The bag should be inside the pan, not hanging over the pan's edges—close the oven bag with the included nylon tie.</li>
            <li>If you are not using an oven bag: Place the pork and marinade in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 2 to 2 ½ hours, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 150°F in the thickest part.</li>
            <li>If using an oven bag, remove the roasting pan from the oven, cut open the top of the bag, and carefully remove it. If not, go to the next step.</li>
            <li>Pour the cola soda and beer over the pork and return to the oven to roast for further 30 - 45 minutes, basting with juices the pork 2 -3 times, or until the pork reaches 160°F in the thickest part.</li>
            <li>Remove pork onto a serving platter, cover loosely with foil and let it rest for 20 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Strain all the juices through a fine-mesh strainer to remove, fat, herbs, and bay leaf. If you want to thicken the sauce, place it in a saucepan and simmer on medium-high for 5 minutes or until it reduces down to a syrupy consistency. To thicken, even more, you can add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li>Cut meat from the bone. Serve and pan juices.</li>
        </ol>
