        <h4><em>This recipe has more than 100 years accompanying Venezuelans at Christmas thanks to the use of representative ingredients of those holidays. Its original version is a semi-sweet bread dough filled with cooked ham and decorated with raisins and olives. Some have made updated versions with puff pastry, cream cheese, and bacon.</em></h4>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking tray with lightly greased parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine milk and water and microwave in 30-second increments until the mixture is warmed <em>(110°F approx.,)</em></li>
            <li>Add flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook (bread paddle) attachment. Make a well in the center and add the milk mixture, egg and melted butter to the well; mix on medium speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the bowl's sides, about 8 - 10 minutes. The dough should be elastic but not sticky; if too sticky, add a little more flour, about a tablespoon at a time.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and form a ball. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place until puffy and doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Then, place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it into r 15-x-13 inch (38-x-33 cm) rectangle, about ½ inch (1.5 cm) thick.</li>
            <li>Arrange a row of whole olives on the upper edge. Slice the rest of the olives.</li>
            <li>Line the dough with the ham and bacon slices, slightly overlapping each piece and covering the dough's entire surface.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the raisins and sliced olives on top of the ham, scattering them evenly throughout.</li>
            <li>Firmly roll it up like a Swiss roll. Transfer the roll, seam-side down, to the prepared baking sheet. Put a damp towel, loosely on top of the bread, place it in a warm and humid area in your kitchen, and let it sit for 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350º F (180º C).</li>
            <li>Brush bread with egg wash for all sides. Bake for 40 – 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven, and while is still hot brush with melted butter</li>
            <li>Let the bread cool for 15 – 20 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
